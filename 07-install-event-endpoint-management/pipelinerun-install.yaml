#
# Creates an instance of the Cloud Pak for Integration
#  Event Endpoint Management capability
#
# Installs the Operator first if it's not already
#  available.
#
# Note that this only deploys the multi-tenant
#  API Manager "cloud", so the setup pipeline needs
#  to be run after this to provision/configure
#  a single instance that is hosted by the cloud
#  createdd by this install pipeline.
